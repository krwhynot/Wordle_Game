# Comprehensive Troubleshooting Workflow Guide for Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone (2025)

You are an expert CLine Prompt Engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive troubleshooting workflow guide for a mobile-first Wordle clone. This project utilizes a modern tech stack within a monorepo structure, specifically:
* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
* **Backend**: Express, TypeScript, Node.js
* **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)
* **Styling**: SCSS with Material 3 Expressive design principles and a Turquoise/Tangerine color scheme.
* **Deployment**: Azure App Service and Azure Static Web Apps.

The project is currently in its early development phases with the basic structure established.

To ensure this guide is up-to-date and highly effective, you will leverage the `tavily` and `brave_search` tools to gather the latest and most relevant troubleshooting techniques for each component of our tech stack and Azure integration.

**Your workflow will be as follows:**

1.  **Initial Research:**
    * First, use `tavily` to perform a broad search for "latest general software troubleshooting techniques 2025" to capture foundational and cutting-edge methodologies.
    * Next, use `brave_search` to search for "React TypeScript Vite frontend troubleshooting techniques" and "Express Node.js TypeScript backend troubleshooting best practices".
    * Then, use `tavily` to search for "Azure App Service deployment troubleshooting" and "Azure Static Web App deployment issues".
    * Finally, use `brave_search` to find "Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API troubleshooting common errors" and "Cosmos DB performance optimization techniques".

2.  **Guide Compilation:** Based on the gathered information, compile a comprehensive troubleshooting workflow guide specifically tailored for our Wordle clone project. Structure the guide with the following detailed sections:

    <detailed_sequence_of_steps>

    ## 1. General Troubleshooting Framework
    ### 1.1 Systematic Diagnosis Approach
    * Isolate the Problem (frontend, backend, database, integration, specific error messages, reproduction steps)
    * Gather Information (error messages, stack traces, logs, environment details, recent code changes)
    * Verify Environment Setup (dependencies, environment variables, network connectivity)
    * Apply Structured Testing (isolated components, minimal test cases, automated tests, environment comparison)
    ### 1.2 Logical Resolution Steps
    * Consult Documentation (official docs, GitHub issues, communities)
    * Apply Incremental Fixes (one change at a time, testing, tracking, reverting)
    * Escalate Methodically (community forums, minimal reproducible examples, team members, library bugs)
    * Document Findings (root cause, solution, knowledge base updates, regression tests)

    ## 2. Frontend-Specific Troubleshooting (React/TypeScript/Vite)
    ### 2.1 Build and Compilation Errors
    * TypeScript Type Errors (incompatible assignments, import paths, `--noEmit`, Vite plugin settings)
    * Vite Configuration Issues (`vite.config.ts`, plugins, proxy settings, version updates)
    * Dependency Conflicts (`npm ls`, peer dependencies, `npm ci`, compatibility)
    ### 2.2 Runtime and Rendering Issues
    * Component Rendering Problems (lifecycle, state updates, `useEffect` dependencies, race conditions)
    * React Context API Errors (providers, initialization, circular dependencies, DevTools)
    * UI and Style Inconsistencies (SCSS compilation, CSS custom properties, browser/screen size testing, DevTools)
    ### 2.3 Debugging Tools and Techniques
    * Browser DevTools Utilization (React DevTools, breakpoints, network requests, performance analysis)
    * Vite-Specific Debugging (error overlay, `--debug`, terminal output, source maps)

    ## 3. Backend Troubleshooting (Node.js/Express/TypeScript)
    ### 3.1 Server Startup Issues
    * Port Binding Errors (`EADDRINUSE`, environment variables, shutdown, alternate ports)
    * Module Resolution Problems (tsconfig, circular dependencies, missing dependencies, module formats)
    * Environment Configuration Issues (`.env`, missing variables, file paths, secret access)
    ### 3.2 API and Request Handling Errors
    * Route Definition Problems (duplicates, HTTP methods, middleware order, parameters)
    * Request Validation Issues (input validation, content types, input formats, error responses)
    * Response Handling Problems (uncaught exceptions, status codes, headers, JSON formatting)
    ### 3.3 Debugging Tools and Techniques
    * Server Logging (comprehensive logging, debug statements, request/response details, timing)
    * Debugging Node.js Applications (Node.js inspector, VS Code debugging, breakpoints, variable analysis)

    ## 4. Database and Azure Cosmos DB Troubleshooting
    ### 4.1 Connection Issues
    * Connection String Problems (format, credentials, network connectivity, firewall, Data Explorer)
    * Authentication Errors (account keys, expired credentials, RBAC, IP restrictions)
    * Configuration Issues (database/collection names, MongoDB API compatibility, connection pooling, timeouts)
    ### 4.2 Query and Operation Errors
    * Query Performance Problems (missing indexes, efficient patterns, execution statistics, RU consumption)
    * Rate Limiting and Throughput Issues (HTTP 429, throughput monitoring, exponential backoff, RU/s scaling)
    * Data Modeling Problems (document structure, oversized documents, optimal design, partition key selection)
    ### 4.3 Debugging Tools and Techniques
    * Azure Portal Diagnostics (Metrics, Activity Logs, Diagnostic Logs, Data Explorer)
    * Local Development Testing (Cosmos DB Emulator, request/response analysis, detailed logging, isolated test cases)

    ## 5. Azure Deployment and Integration Troubleshooting
    ### 5.1 Deployment Failures
    * Build Process Issues (build script errors, Node.js version, dependencies, environment config)
    * Service Configuration Problems (App Service settings, startup command, web.config, runtime stack)
    * Static Web App Deployment Issues (build output path, GitHub Actions workflow, routing, build environment variables)
    ### 5.2 Runtime Integration Problems
    * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Issues (App Service settings, origin configs, headers, specific origin testing)
    * API Connectivity Problems (endpoint URLs, network security groups, authentication, independent testing)
