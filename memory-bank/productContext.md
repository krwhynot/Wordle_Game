# Product Context: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of this project is to develop a fully functional, mobile-first Wordle clone. This serves as a practical learning experience for building full-stack web applications using modern technologies (React, Node.js/Express) and integrating them with a professional cloud infrastructure (Microsoft Azure). It aims to bridge beginner-friendly web development concepts with real-world cloud deployment and best practices.

## Problem Solved
This project addresses several aspects:
1.  **Learning and Skill Development**: Provides a hands-on opportunity to learn and apply skills in frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Express), database management (Azure Cosmos DB), state management (React Context API), and cloud services (Azure).
2.  **Portfolio Piece**: Creates a tangible, deployable application that can serve as a portfolio item showcasing modern web development and cloud integration capabilities.
3.  **Recreation of a Popular Game**: Offers a chance to understand the mechanics and design principles behind a successful and engaging word game.
4.  **Exploration of Best Practices**: Serves as a platform to implement and understand software engineering best practices in a real-world context, including mobile-first design, CI/CD, and performance optimization.

## User Experience (UX) Goals
The Wordle clone should provide an exceptional user experience, particularly on mobile devices. Key UX goals include:
-   **Simplicity and Elegance**: Mirror the straightforward and engaging gameplay of the original Wordle.
-   **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure a seamless and intuitive experience on small screens, adapting gracefully to larger displays.
-   **Performance**:
    -   Fast initial load time (target under 2 seconds).
    -   Responsive touch interactions with no perceptible lag.
    -   Efficient animations that enhance, not hinder, gameplay and battery life.
    -   Minimal network requests during active gameplay.
-   **Responsiveness**: Adapt layouts flexibly across various devices and orientations, ensuring touch targets are accessible (minimum 44x44px).
-   **Intuitive Interactions**: Clear visual feedback for guesses, letter status, and game progression.
-   **Accessibility**: Strive for good accessibility, potentially including features like high-contrast mode and screen reader compatibility in future iterations.
-   **Offline Capability (Potential)**: Explore service worker caching for core assets and local storage for game state persistence to allow gameplay even when offline.
-   **Engaging Feedback**: Use animations and toasts to provide clear and delightful feedback to the user.

## Target Audience
-   **Primary**: The developer (user of Cline) undertaking this project to learn and build a portfolio piece.
-   **Secondary**: Potential players who enjoy word puzzle games.

## Success Metrics (from a development perspective)
-   Successful implementation of all core Wordle game mechanics.
-   Effective integration of frontend, backend, and Azure cloud services.
-   A well-structured, maintainable codebase that follows best practices.
-   A fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deployments.
-   A high-quality, responsive user interface that performs well on mobile devices.
