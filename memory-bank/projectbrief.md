# Project Brief: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Project Overview
This project is to build a mobile-first Wordle clone as a full-stack web application. The implementation will follow modern web development practices with a strategic focus on Azure cloud infrastructure for scalability, security, and maintainability. The development will be AI-guided, focusing on progressive enhancement and component-first development.

## Core Requirements
- **Functionality**: Implement the core Wordle game mechanics (5-letter word, 6 attempts, feedback on letter correctness and position).
- **Technology Stack**:
    - Frontend: React.js with component-based architecture.
    - Backend: Node.js with Express (RESTful API endpoints).
    - Database: Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API.
    - State Management: React Context API.
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive design.
- **Development Environment**:
    - Create-React-App with Express proxy.
    - VSCode with specific configurations for settings, tasks, and debugging.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Microsoft Azure ecosystem.
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps.

## Key Project Goals
- Create an engaging and functional Wordle clone.
- Implement a clean, maintainable codebase adhering to best practices.
- Set up an efficient development workflow using VSCode configurations.
- Ensure seamless Azure integration for all backend and frontend components.
- Achieve a high-quality mobile user experience.
- Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

## Project Structure
- `client/`: React frontend application.
- `server/`: Node.js/Express backend application.
- `.vscode/`: VSCode specific configurations (`settings.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`).
- `Docs/`: Project documentation including blueprint, best practices, and AI guide instructions.

## AI Development Partner Role
The AI (Cline) will:
- Maintain project context based on established blueprints.
- Balance education with implementation-ready code.
- Guide progressive development according to defined phases.
- Provide complete, functional code solutions.
- Prioritize Azure-native solutions and provide configuration guidance.
- Ensure technical consistency with the chosen stack.
- Adhere to output requirements: complete code, file structure context, architectural rationale, next steps, and resource configuration.
- Consider beginner-friendly explanations, performance optimization, security best practices, cost management, and progressive complexity.
