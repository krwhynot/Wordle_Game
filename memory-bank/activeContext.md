# Active Context: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on establishing the foundational elements of the Wordle Clone project. This includes:
1.  Setting up the VSCode development environment with appropriate configurations for settings, tasks, and debugging.
2.  Initializing the Memory Bank with comprehensive project information derived from provided documentation (`Docs/` directory).

## Recent Changes / Accomplishments
-   Created the `.vscode/` directory.
-   Successfully created and populated:
    -   `.vscode/settings.json`
    -   `.vscode/tasks.json`
    -   `.vscode/launch.json`
-   Created the `memory-bank/` directory.
-   Initialized the core Memory Bank files:
    -   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
    -   `memory-bank/productContext.md`
    -   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
    -   `memory-bank/techContext.md`
    -   (This file, `memory-bank/activeContext.md`)

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  Complete the initialization of the Memory Bank by creating/populating `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2.  Based on `Docs/wordle-azure-project.md` (Section 10: Next Steps):
    -   Discuss creation of Azure account and resource groups (if not already done by the user).
    -   Plan the setup of the initial React application using Create-React-App for the `client/` directory.
    -   Plan the setup of the initial Node.js/Express application for the `server/` directory.
    -   Begin Phase 1: Frontend Foundations, starting with project structure and static components.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   **Project Initialization**: The project is in its nascent stages. The immediate priority is setting up the development environment and project structure.
-   **AI Guidance**: Adhering to the `Docs/wordle-claude-project-instructions.md` for AI (Cline) interaction patterns, focusing on providing complete, educational, and context-aware guidance.
-   **Documentation-Driven Development**: The `Docs/` directory serves as the primary source of truth for project requirements, architecture, and best practices. Memory Bank files are being populated to internalize this information for the AI.
-   **VSCode Configuration**: The newly created VSCode configurations are designed to support a full-stack workflow with distinct client and server components. These will be tested once the `client/` and `server/` directories are populated.

## Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
-   **Structured Documentation**: Emphasis on maintaining a well-organized Memory Bank.
-   **Azure-Centric Approach**: Cloud services and infrastructure will heavily leverage Microsoft Azure.
-   **Mobile-First Development**: This principle will guide UI/UX design and implementation from the outset.
-   **Component-Based Architecture (React)**: Frontend development will follow this pattern.
-   **RESTful APIs (Express)**: Backend services will be exposed via REST.
-   **Progressive Enhancement**: Features will be built incrementally.

## Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)
-   The project has detailed planning documents (`Docs/`) providing a strong foundation.
-   The user expects the AI (Cline) to be an active partner, maintaining context and guiding development according to the provided instructions.
-   VSCode setup is crucial for an efficient development workflow for this specific full-stack, Azure-integrated project.
-   The Memory Bank is critical for the AI's effectiveness due to session memory resets.
