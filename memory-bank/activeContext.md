# Active Context: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Current Work Focus
Completed a comprehensive review of all code files in the client, server, and shared packages. Identified and addressed high-confidence errors. Documented remaining issues, warnings, and development placeholders.

## Recent Changes / Accomplishments
-   **Completed Code Review:** Reviewed all `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.scss` files in `wordle-game/packages/client/src`, `wordle-game/packages/server/src`, and `wordle-game/packages/shared/src`.
-   **Applied High-Confidence Fixes:**
    -   **`main.tsx` (Client):** Added null check for `document.getElementById('root')`.
    -   **`rateLimiter.ts` (Server):** Added `isNaN` checks and fallbacks for `parseInt` on environment variables.
    -   **`securityConfig.ts` (Server):** Corrected `connectSrc` CSP directive type issue.
    -   **`Keyboard.tsx` (Client):** Corrected `GameContext` import path.
    -   **`Header.tsx` (Client):** Corrected `ThemeContext` and `GameContext` import paths.
    -   **Resolved TypeScript Server Cache Issues:** User confirmed restarting TS server resolved previous casing and Vite plugin errors.
-   **Identified and Documented Remaining Issues:** Listed critical issues requiring user action, low-priority warnings/optimizations, and development placeholders.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **User Action Required:** User must verify and rename `wordle-game/packages/client/src/components/game/Key/Keymodule.scss` to `Key.module.scss` to fix a critical filename casing mismatch preventing styles from loading.
2.  **Test Application Compilation:** After the user addresses the critical issue, attempt to run `npm run dev` for both client and server to verify that all errors are resolved and no new ones were introduced.
3.  **Address any new errors:** If new errors appear during compilation or runtime, address them.
4.  **Consider Low-Priority Issues:** Review the documented list of warnings, optimizations, and development placeholders for potential future work.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   All initially reported errors have been addressed.
-   A critical filename casing issue was identified during the code review that requires user intervention.
-   Several low-priority warnings and development placeholders were noted for future consideration.

## Important Patterns & Preferences (Reinforced)
-   Consistent use of path aliases (`@/`) in the client.
-   Robust handling of environment variables (parsing, conditional inclusion).
-   Importance of correct file/directory casing and TS server restarts after renames.
-   Standard barrel file usage for module exports.
-   Well-structured error handling middleware.
-   Use of CSS Modules naming conventions (`.module.scss`).

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   Comprehensive code review revealed issues beyond those initially reported by the TS server, including filename casing and potential runtime issues.
-   Even seemingly minor details like environment variable parsing or file naming conventions can lead to critical errors.
-   The project has a solid foundation with good practices in place (TypeScript, React Context, Express middleware, SCSS theming), but requires further implementation for core game logic and backend features.
