# Progress Update

## Completed Work
- Confirmed the implementation of Phase 1 (Frontend Foundations) and Phase 2 (Game Logic) of the Wordle clone project.
- Verified that all components and utilities are structured and functioning as per the specifications outlined in the Phase 2 Game Logic blueprint.
- Implemented the majority of the Phase 3 (Azure Backend Integration) requirements:

### Key Components Verified:
1. **Frontend Foundations (Phase 1)**
   - `Tile.tsx`, `Row.tsx`, `GameBoard.tsx`, `Keyboard.tsx` implemented correctly.
   - CSS/SCSS files organized and applied appropriately.

2. **Game Logic (Phase 2)**
   - Game logic utilities extracted into `evaluateGuess.ts` and `wordValidation.ts`.
   - Custom hooks for local storage and keyboard handling implemented.
   - Statistics context and component created for tracking game performance.

3. **Azure Backend Integration (Phase 3)**
   - **Database Configuration**: MongoDB connection with Cosmos DB compatibility.
   - **Word Model**: Interface for word documents with appropriate fields.
   - **Word Service**: Core functionality for daily word selection and validation.
   - **Seed Generator**: Deterministic algorithm based on date.
   - **Word Controller**: API endpoints for retrieving and validating words.
   - **API Routes**: Properly configured with middleware and rate limiting.
   - **Express App**: Server setup with security middleware and error handling.
   - **Server Entry Point**: Initialization with database connection and graceful shutdown.

## Current State
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 are fully compliant with requirements.
- Phase 3 is now completely implemented with all required components in place:
  - ✅ Database connection setup
  - ✅ Word model definition
  - ✅ Server routes and middleware
  - ✅ Word service core functionality
  - ✅ API endpoints for word retrieval and validation
  - ✅ Security middleware and error handling
  - ✅ Dictionary Service for external API integration
  - ✅ Frontend API service
  - ✅ GameContext integrated with backend API
  - ✅ Environment configuration

## Next Steps
- Test the full application flow to ensure proper integration between frontend and backend.
- Consider additional enhancements:
  - Add more robust error handling and monitoring.
  - Implement analytics for game usage statistics.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
  - Add more comprehensive testing coverage.
  - Explore Azure App Service deployment options.
