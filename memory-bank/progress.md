# Project Progress: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Current Status: Project Initialization (Phase 0)
The project is currently in its initial setup phase. Foundational elements like VSCode configuration and Memory Bank initialization are being established. No application code (frontend or backend) has been written yet.

## What Works / Completed Tasks
-   **VSCode Environment Setup**:
    -   `.vscode/` directory created.
    -   `.vscode/settings.json` configured for workspace settings.
    -   `.vscode/tasks.json` configured for development and deployment tasks.
    -   `.vscode/launch.json` configured for full-stack debugging.
-   **Memory Bank Initialization**:
    -   `memory-bank/` directory created.
    -   Core Memory Bank files populated with initial project context derived from `Docs/` directory:
        -   `projectbrief.md`
        -   `productContext.md`
        -   `systemPatterns.md`
        -   `techContext.md`
        -   `activeContext.md`
        -   `progress.md` (this file)
-   **Documentation Review**:
    -   `Docs/wordle-azure-project.md` (Blueprint)
    -   `Docs/wordle-best-practices.md` (Best Practices)
    -   `Docs/wordle-claude-project-instructions.md` (AI Guide Instructions)
    The content of these documents has been processed and is being integrated into the Memory Bank.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level Implementation Phases from Blueprint)
The overall project will follow these phases as outlined in `Docs/wordle-azure-project.md`:

-   **Phase 1: Frontend Foundations**
    -   Create React project structure (`client/`).
    -   Build static UI components (game board, keyboard).
    -   Implement basic styling (CSS/SCSS).
    -   Set up mobile-first responsive design.
-   **Phase 2: Game Logic (Frontend)**
    -   Implement React Context API for state management.
    -   Create guess validation logic (client-side part).
    -   Build letter evaluation algorithm (client-side part).
    -   Develop keyboard interaction.
    -   Add animations and transitions.
-   **Phase 3: Azure Backend Integration**
    -   Set up Azure Cosmos DB instance (MongoDB API).
    -   Create Express server structure (`server/`) on Azure App Service.
    -   Configure Azure Key Vault for secure API key storage.
    -   Build RESTful API endpoints (`/api/word/daily`, `/api/word/validate`).
    -   Implement dictionary API integration (if external).
    -   Develop daily word selection logic (backend).
-   **Phase 4: Statistics & Polish**
    -   Add local statistics tracking (localStorage).
    -   Implement comprehensive UI feedback (toasts, messages).
    -   Add share functionality.
    -   Write unit tests for game logic.
    -   Polish mobile experience.
    -   Optimize performance.
-   **Phase 5: Azure Deployment & DevOps**
    -   Configure Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline.
    -   Set up Azure Static Web Apps for frontend hosting.
    -   Deploy backend to Azure App Service.
    -   Implement Azure Application Insights monitoring.
    -   Configure Azure CDN for content delivery.
    -   Set up automatic scaling rules for Azure App Service.

## Known Issues / Blockers
-   None at this very early stage. The `client/` and `server/` directories, along with their respective project initializations (Create React App, Express setup), are pending.
-   Azure resource creation (Cosmos DB, App Service, etc.) needs to be planned and executed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **Initial Decision (User Task)**: Set up VSCode configuration files. This has been completed.
-   **Follow-up Decision (User Feedback)**: Populate Memory Bank based on `Docs/` directory. This is currently in progress and nearing completion.
-   The project will follow the detailed blueprint and best practices outlined in the `Docs/` directory. No deviations have been made so far.

## Next Milestones
1.  **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**: Ensure all core files are adequately populated.
2.  **Plan Project Scaffolding**:
    -   Discuss and plan the creation of the `client/` directory using `create-react-app`.
    -   Discuss and plan the creation of the `server/` directory with a basic Express.js setup.
3.  **Azure Setup Discussion**: Clarify if Azure account and basic resource groups are in place, or if guidance is needed.
4.  **Begin Phase 1 (Frontend Foundations)**: Start with creating the React project structure.
