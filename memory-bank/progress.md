# Project Progress: Azure-Integrated Wordle Clone

## Current Status: Error Resolution Complete (Phase 0/1)
All user-provided TypeScript configuration and import errors have been resolved. The project is now ready for verification of barrel file exports and initial compilation/runtime testing.

## What Works / Completed Tasks
-   **VSCode Environment Setup**: Completed.
-   **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core files populated.
-   **Documentation Review**: Completed.
-   **Error Resolution (Completed):**
    -   **Corrected File/Directory Casing:**
        -   Server middleware files (`errorHandler.ts`, `rateLimiter.ts`, `validation.ts`).
        -   Client `components/layout` directory.
    -   **Updated Import Paths:**
        -   Corrected import for `Header` in `client/src/App.tsx` due to casing change.
        -   Standardized client-side imports in `client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/components/game/GameBoard/GameBoard.tsx`, `client/src/components/game/Keyboard/Keyboard.tsx`, and `client/src/components/Layout/Header/Header.tsx` to use `@/` path alias.
    -   **Restructured Server `index.ts`:**
        -   Removed duplicated code.
        -   Corrected `dotenv` import.
    -   **Updated Server `tsconfig.json`:**
        -   Ensured `esModuleInterop: true`, `module: "NodeNext"`, `moduleResolution: "NodeNext"`.
    -   **Updated Server `securityConfig.ts`:**
        -   Corrected `connectSrc` CSP directive to properly handle potentially undefined `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`.
    -   **Added SCSS Module Declarations (Client):**
        -   Created `client/src/vite-env.d.ts` with type declarations for CSS/SCSS modules.
    -   **Reviewed and Updated Client `tsconfig.json`:**
        -   Added `"types": ["vite/client", "vitest/globals"]`.
    -   **Updated Client `vite.config.ts`:**
        -   Added `/// <reference types="vitest" />`.
    -   **Updated Client Dependencies:**
        -   Ran `npm install vite@latest @vitejs/plugin-react@latest vitest@latest` in `packages/client`.
    -   **Resolved TypeScript Server Cache Issues:**
        -   User confirmed restarting TS server resolved casing conflicts and module resolution errors for Vite plugin.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level from Blueprint)
-   **Phase 1: Frontend Foundations** (Ready to proceed)
-   **Phase 2: Game Logic (Frontend)**
-   **Phase 3: Azure Backend Integration**
-   **Phase 4: Statistics & Polish**
-   **Phase 5: Azure Deployment & DevOps**

## Known Issues / Blockers
-   **None currently identified.** All previously listed TypeScript errors have been addressed. Potential new issues may arise during compilation/runtime testing or barrel file verification.
-   **Project Scaffolding**: `client/` and `server/` directories exist. The focus has been on making them error-free.
-   **Azure Resource Creation**: Not yet started.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   VSCode configuration and initial Memory Bank setup completed.
-   Successfully addressed all TypeScript errors provided by the user by correcting configurations, paths, file names, and type definitions, and by guiding the user to restart the TS server.

## Next Milestones
1.  **Verify Barrel File Exports**: Proactively double-check all `index.ts` files in component and context directories to ensure correct exports.
2.  **Test Application Compilation**: Attempt `npm run dev` for both client and server.
3.  **Address any new errors**: If new errors appear during compilation or runtime, address them.
4.  **Proceed with Phase 1 (Frontend Foundations)**: Once the application compiles and runs without issues, continue building static UI components.
