# Workflow: Blueprint and Planning Phase

<!--
This workflow guides the project through system architecture visualization, requirement documentation,
and an initial step-by-step implementation plan â€” prior to any code being written.
It is copy-ready and compliant with your `.windsurf/workflows/` requirements.
-->

## Description

Establish the architectural blueprint, define project requirements, and generate a detailed plan before development begins.

---

## Steps

1. **Visualize Architecture**
   - Use Mermaid to map out system components and relationships.
   - Example: Generate Mermaid diagram showing services, databases, and APIs.

2. **Define High-Level Requirements**
   - Document major features and constraints.
   - Create a `project-config.md` or similar to store requirements and coding rules.

3. **Specify Coding Standards**
   - Include naming conventions, folder structure, language rules, etc.
   - Add them as a dedicated section in the documentation or config.

4. **Generate Implementation Plan**
   - Use AI to produce detailed pseudocode or task sequence.
   - Ensure plan reflects system architecture and coding rules.

5. **Await User Approval**
   - DO NOT proceed to coding until human has approved the plan.
   - Add comment like: `<!-- Human confirmation required before moving forward -->`

## Notes

<!--
- Each step is designed to be completed before any code is written.
- This sets the foundation for a maintainable, well-structured codebase.
- This file is copy-ready and compliant with your `.windsurf/workflows/` directory format.

## Completion Status

âœ… **Step 1: Visualize Architecture** - Complete
- Created comprehensive Mermaid diagrams in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Mapped system components, data flow, security, and deployment architecture

âœ… **Step 2: Define High-Level Requirements** - Complete  
- Documented in Azure F&B Wordle project configuration memory
- Covered technical requirements, performance targets, and user experience goals

âœ… **Step 3: Specify Coding Standards** - Complete
- Comprehensive coding standards defined in global rules memory
- Project-specific patterns documented in Wordle Game Project memory

âœ… **Step 4: Generate Implementation Plan** - Complete
- Detailed implementation plan created in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Cross-referenced with existing 24 Taskmaster tasks
- Phase-by-phase approach with dependencies and timelines

âœ… **Step 5: Await User Approval** - Complete
- User approved the blueprint and plan
- Now proceeding with implementation starting with accessibility features

## Implementation Status

ðŸ”„ **Currently Working On**: Task 2.1 - Adding accessibility attributes to game board
- Implementing ARIA roles and labels for GameBoard component
- Adding proper keyboard navigation support
- Ensuring screen reader compatibility

**Next Steps**: Complete remaining subtasks for Task 2 (Core Game Board UI Components)
