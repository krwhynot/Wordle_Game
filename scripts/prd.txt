## Questions & Clarifications

* **Word Rotation Scope**: Should the 30-word rotation be per-player (stored in session) or global across all players? Per-player provides better variety but requires session tracking.

* **Name Persistence**: Should player names persist across browser sessions using localStorage, or reset each session for privacy?

* **Word Categories**: Do you have specific F&B term categories in mind (ingredients, techniques, equipment), or should we use the full 3000-word list randomly?

* **Historical Gameplay**: Should past games be fully playable with stats tracking, or view-only for reference?

* **Stats Granularity**: Do we need individual player statistics, or is aggregate-only sufficient for MVP?

* **Offline Support**: Should the game support offline play with synchronization when reconnected?

* **Compliance Requirements**: Any specific data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) we need to consider for the 10-user scope?

* **Domain Integration**: Is kjrcloud.com already configured with Namecheap? Any existing DNS records to preserve?

## List of Architecture Consideration Questions

* **Scaling Strategy**: Should we architect for potential viral growth beyond 10 users from day one, or optimize purely for cost and refactor if needed?

* **Caching Aggressiveness**: How aggressive should client-side caching be? Cache everything possible or maintain some server-side control?

* **API Versioning**: Should we implement API versioning from the start for future backwards compatibility?

* **Monitoring Depth**: What level of Application Insights tracking? Basic availability or detailed user behavior analytics?

* **Deployment Strategy**: Simple push-to-main deployments or full blue-green with staging environment?

* **Data Retention**: How long should we retain game history? 30 days, 90 days, or indefinite?

* **Rate Limiting**: Even with 10 users, should we implement rate limiting to prevent abuse?

* **CDN Configuration**: Use default Azure CDN settings or optimize for specific geographic regions?

* **Disaster Recovery**: For <$1/month budget, what's the acceptable recovery time objective (RTO)?

* **CI/CD Complexity**: Minimal GitHub Actions or comprehensive testing pipeline with quality gates?

* **Session Management**: Browser session only or implement proper session tokens for future authentication?

* **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages or detailed technical errors for debugging?

* **Internationalization**: Prepare architecture for future multi-language support or keep English-only?

* **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from start or plan for future accessibility audit?

* **Performance Budgets**: Specific targets for Time to Interactive (TTI) and First Contentful Paint (FCP)?
