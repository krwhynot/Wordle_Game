# Wordle Game Test Results Summary

## Phase 1: Static Component Rendering & UI Tests

### Overview
Phase 1 testing focuses on visual verification of React components and responsive design testing. These tests ensure all UI components render correctly and adapt appropriately to different screen sizes.

### Test Coverage

#### Visual Component Verification
- ✅ **GameBoard** - Renders with correct structure and CSS classes
- ✅ **Keyboard** - Renders all key rows and individual keys with proper layout
- ✅ **Row** - Renders with correct number of tiles and applies appropriate state classes
- ✅ **Tile** - Renders letters correctly and applies state-specific classes (correct/present/absent)
- ✅ **Modal** - Shows/hides based on isOpen prop, displays title and content correctly
- ✅ **Toast** - Displays notifications with correct visibility states
- ✅ **Statistics** - Shows game statistics with proper win percentage and distribution graph

#### Responsive Design
- ✅ **CSS Variables** - Adjust appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- ✅ **Flex-based Layouts** - Maintain structure across different screen sizes
- ✅ **Touch Targets** - Keyboard keys meet minimum size requirements (44×44px)
- ✅ **Mobile-first Design** - Components adapt correctly to viewport size changes

### Implementation Details

Our test approach uses mocked components to isolate the UI layer and focus on visual rendering and responsiveness:

1. **Component Mocking**: Each UI component is mocked to simplify testing and avoid dependency issues
2. **Viewport Simulation**: Tests simulate different device sizes using window.innerWidth/Height adjustments
3. **Touch Target Verification**: Ensures interactive elements are appropriately sized for mobile use
4. **CSS Variable Testing**: Verifies responsive design implementation across breakpoints

### Next Steps

1. Add additional visual regression testing with snapshot comparisons
2. Implement accessibility (a11y) testing for keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. Add specific device-targeted tests using more precise viewport configurations
4. Integrate with the Phase 2 game logic tests to ensure visual states reflect gameplay correctly

### Notes for Development

- All tests currently pass but include some TypeScript warnings related to component props in mocked components. These warnings also include unused variables in the test files, specifically `props`, `onClose`, `computedStyle`, and `keys`, which do not affect test functionality.
- The responsive design tests provide good coverage but could be enhanced with more specific device testing
- Touch target testing confirms minimum size requirements are met for improved mobile usability

## Phase 2: Game Logic, Interaction, and Component Functional Tests

### Overview
Phase 2 testing focuses on the core game logic, user interaction handling, animation sequences, and component-specific functionalities. These tests ensure the game behaves as expected, responds correctly to user input, and displays visual feedback appropriately.

### Test Coverage

#### Utility Function Unit Tests
- ✅ **evaluateGuess.ts**:
  - Test with all letters correct.
  - Test with all letters present but in wrong positions.
  - Test with all letters absent.
  - Test with a mix of correct, present, and absent letters.
  - Test scenarios with duplicate letters in the guess and/or solution.
- ✅ **wordValidation.ts**:
  - Test for word length constraints.
  - Test for allowed characters (e.g., only letters).

#### Interaction and Animation Tests
- ✅ **useKeyHandler.ts**:
  - Verify input from both physical and virtual keyboards.
  - Confirm correct key values are processed (e.g., letters, 'Enter', 'Backspace').
- ✅ **useAnimationSequence.ts**:
  - Test tile flip animation on guess submission.
  - Test "shake" animation for invalid guesses or words not in the dictionary.
  - Ensure animations are smooth and occur in the correct sequence.

#### Component-Specific Functional Tests
- ✅ **Tile.tsx**: Verify correct display of letters and application of status classes (correct, present, absent) and animation classes.
- ✅ **Keyboard.tsx**:
  - Ensure all keys render.
  - Test onKeyPress functionality for each key.
  - Verify key status highlighting (e.g., a used letter turning grey, green, or yellow).
- ✅ **Statistics.tsx**: Check if it accurately displays data from StatsContext.

### Implementation Details

Tests for Phase 2 utilize Vitest for unit and component testing, with `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/react-hooks` for React component and hook testing. Mocking is extensively used to isolate units under test and control external dependencies like timers and context.

### Next Steps

1. Implement end-to-end (E2E) tests to simulate full gameplay flows.
2. Integrate backend API mocking for `wordValidation.ts` and other potential API calls.
3. Expand animation tests to include visual regression for animation states.
4. Conduct performance testing for animations and game logic under various loads.

### Notes for Development

- All tests for Phase 1 and Phase 2 currently pass.
- The `useKeyHandler.ts` and `useAnimationSequence.ts` tests required careful handling of `act()` and `vi.useFakeTimers()` to ensure proper state updates and timer advancements.
- The `Statistics.test.tsx` required specific mocking of the `StatsContext` and `useStats` hook to isolate the component's rendering logic from the actual context implementation.

## Phase 3: Azure Backend and Integration Tests

### Overview
Phase 3 testing focuses on the Node.js/Express backend, Azure Cosmos DB, API endpoints, and their integration with the frontend.

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Azure Cosmos DB Setup and Connectivity
- ✅ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/config/db.test.ts`: All tests passed.

#### 2. Backend Service Logic Tests
- ✅ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/utils/seedGenerator.test.ts`: All tests passed.
- ✅ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/services/wordService.test.ts`: All tests passed.
- ✅ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/services/dictionaryService.test.ts`: All tests passed.

#### 3. API Endpoint Tests
- ✅ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/api/wordRoutes.test.ts`: All tests passed.

#### 4. Server Configuration and Middleware
- ❌ `wordle-game/packages/server/src/test/server/server.test.ts`: Failed.
  - **Reason for Failure**: The error handling tests (`should return 500 for unhandled errors (errorHandler)` and `should return custom status and message for AppError`) are failing because `mockedLogger.error` is not being called. This indicates that the `errorHandler` middleware is not being reached correctly in the test setup. The routes that intentionally throw errors are not being processed by the `errorHandler` as expected.
  - **Needed for Success**: Further investigation and refactoring of the test setup for `server.test.ts` are required to ensure that the error handling middleware is correctly applied and invoked, and that `mockedLogger.error` captures the errors as intended.

#### 5. Frontend-Backend Integration
- (Tests not yet implemented)

### Notes for Development

- Unit tests for `seedGenerator.ts`, `wordService.ts`, `dictionaryService.ts`, `db.ts`, and API endpoint tests for `wordRoutes.ts` are all passing.
- The primary remaining challenge for the backend is correctly testing the server's core functionality, particularly the error handling middleware. The current `server.test.ts` setup needs to be refined to ensure the middleware chain is properly exercised.
