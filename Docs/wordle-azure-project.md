# Mobile-First Wordle Clone: Azure-Integrated Implementation Blueprint

## Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture and implementation strategy for building a Wordle clone as a full-stack web application. The project embraces modern web development practices with a strategic focus on Azure cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 1. Core Architecture

The foundation of our Wordle implementation leverages these key technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js with component-based architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (RESTful API endpoints)  
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API
- **State Management**: React Context API for centralized game state
- **Development Environment**: Create-React-App with Express proxy
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Microsoft Azure ecosystem

## 2. Component Structure

Our React application will be organized around these primary components:

- **App.js**: Main container with Context providers
- **GameBoard.jsx**: Core game grid component
- **Keyboard.jsx**: Interactive keyboard with letter state highlighting
- **Statistics.jsx**: Player performance visualization
- **Header.jsx**: Game navigation and information
- **Instructions.jsx**: How-to-play modal component
- **Toast.jsx**: Feedback notifications component

## 3. Data & State Management

The application will use React's Context API for efficient state management:

- **GameContext.js**: Manages core game state
  * Current guesses array
  * Letter evaluation states
  * Game status (in-progress, won, lost)
- **StatsContext.js**: Handles statistics persistence
  * Stores data in localStorage
  * Tracks win streaks and distribution

## 4. API Endpoints

Our RESTful API will include these essential endpoints:

- **/api/word/daily**: Returns daily word
- **/api/word/validate**: Checks if guess is a valid dictionary word
- **/api/statistics**: Optional future endpoint for stat syncing

## 5. Azure Resources Integration

The project will leverage these Azure services for a production-grade implementation:

- **Azure App Service**: Hosting for Node.js Express backend
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Hosting for React frontend
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: MongoDB-compatible database for word storage
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for API keys and secrets
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and analytics
- **Azure DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- **Azure CDN**: Content delivery for optimal global performance

## 6. Database Schema

Our Cosmos DB will use this document structure:

- **Words Collection**:
  * Word (string, indexed)
  * Difficulty (optional future feature)
  * UsedOn (date when word was daily puzzle)

## 7. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Foundations
- Create React project structure
- Build static components (game board, keyboard)
- Implement basic styling with CSS/SCSS
- Set up mobile-first responsive design

### Phase 2: Game Logic
- Implement Context API state management
- Create guess validation logic
- Build letter evaluation algorithm
- Develop keyboard interaction
- Add animations and transitions

### Phase 3: Azure Backend Integration
- Set up Azure Cosmos DB instance with MongoDB API
- Create Express server structure on Azure App Service
- Configure Azure Key Vault for secure API key storage
- Build RESTful API endpoints
- Implement dictionary API integration
- Develop daily word selection logic

### Phase 4: Statistics & Polish
- Add local statistics tracking
- Implement comprehensive UI feedback
- Add share functionality
- Write unit tests for game logic
- Polish mobile experience
- Optimize performance

### Phase 5: Azure Deployment & DevOps
- Configure Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline
- Set up Azure Static Web Apps for frontend hosting
- Deploy backend to Azure App Service
- Implement Azure Application Insights monitoring
- Configure Azure CDN for content delivery
- Set up automatic scaling rules

## 8. Key Technical Challenges

The implementation will need to address these potential hurdles:

- **Word Selection**: Ensuring no repeats and appropriate difficulty
- **State Management**: Maintaining game integrity across refresh
- **Mobile Keyboard**: Handling mobile keyboard interactions
- **API Integration**: Managing dictionary API rate limits
- **Animation Performance**: Ensuring smooth transitions on mobile
- **Azure Resource Management**: Optimizing for cost and performance
- **DevOps Automation**: Creating efficient deployment pipelines

## 9. Learning Resources

These resources will support the development process:

- React Hooks & Context API documentation
- Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API tutorials
- Azure Static Web Apps deployment guides
- Express.js RESTful API tutorials
- Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline setup
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for game board layout
- Jest testing for game logic validation

## 10. Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. Create Azure account and configure resource groups
2. Set up initial React application with Create-React-App
3. Design component wireframes for mobile-first layout
4. Implement static game board component
5. Create Context API structure for game state management
